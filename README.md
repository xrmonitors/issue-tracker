## Frequently Asked Questions

### HP Reverb screens or cameras are flickering

The XRmonitors software adjusts the USB hub power configuration for you to try to reduce that sort of issue.  We have found that unplugging the HMD cable from the headset and replugging it 10 seconds later often resolves this issue.
